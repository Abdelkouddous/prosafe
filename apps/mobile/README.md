# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

### Test Accounts:

- User Account : test@prosafe.com / test123
- Admin Account : admin@prosafe.com / admin123

### Smart Authentication:

1. Backend Detection : Automatically detects if backend is available
2. Fallback Mode : Shows test accounts when backend is offline
3. Dual Authentication : Supports both test accounts and real backend authentication
4. Visual Indicators : Test account buttons appear when backend is unavailable

### Benefits:

- âœ… No Backend Required : Test routing and UI without backend connection
- âœ… Role Testing : Test both user and admin role routing
- âœ… Easy Switching : Click buttons to auto-fill test credentials
- âœ… Production Ready : Seamlessly works with real backend when available
- âœ… Persistent Sessions : Test accounts maintain login state like real accounts

### Usage:

1. With Backend : Normal login works as before
2. Without Backend : Test account buttons appear automatically
3. Testing Roles : Use different test accounts to test user/admin routing
4. Quick Login : Click test account buttons to auto-fill credentials
   The test accounts will bypass all backend calls and allow you to test the complete app navigation and routing system offline!
